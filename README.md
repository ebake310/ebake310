Hi, my name is Emily Baker and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Univsersity of Pavia. My research currently focuses on groundwater flow modeling of an aquifer system in Northern Italy. This work employs finite difference modeling, sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis, and parameter optimization. My prior research consists of stream temperature energy balance modeling, analysis and correction of thermal infrared imagery, and groundwater flow modeling in the Peruvian Andes. This research was primarily conducted using Matlab and Python.

I can be contacted via email at emily.baker@unipv.it.
